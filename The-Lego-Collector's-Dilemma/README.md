### Project Overview

 In this project I'm predicting the price of newly launched Lego set using Linear Regression.


### Learnings from the project

 How Linear Regression helps in predicting and how to improve the accuracy of model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I trained my linear regression model, later i check for correlation between independent variables (features) and removed the variables with high correlation. Afterwards i tested my model and checked for accuracy.

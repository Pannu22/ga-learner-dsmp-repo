### Project Overview

 In this project prediction is made for a customer changing telecom network.


### Learnings from the project

 In this project I learn't to handle missing values , applying AdaBoost and XGBoost.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 At first the dataset was loaded and then the missing values were replaced by mean as missing data can mess with the model. Afterwards the categorial data was Label Encoded as models cannot understand categorial data. Next to it AdaBoost model was applied for making predictions. Now XGBoost was applied to increase the model accuracy, but the accuracy acheived was not of much difference, so GridSearch was applied on XGBoost and an incease in accuracy was acheived.

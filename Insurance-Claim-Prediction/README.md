### Project Overview

 In this project I'm going to make a machine learning model to predict wheather a person is going to make an insurance claim or not.


### Learnings from the project

 In this project I learned to preprocess the data and select useful features. Also learned Hyper parameter tuning for improving the accuracy of model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 For making the machine learning model to predict the claim I used Logistic Regression model. Before this by using various visualization techniquies (pairplot) I checked for the correlation between features. I used boxplot for checking outliers. Then for improving the accuracy of the model I did Hyper parameter tuning using GridSearchCV and finally checked the accuracy of model.

### Project Overview

 In this project prediction is made if the person is going to repay the loan or not.


### Learnings from the project

 While doing this project I learn't about Correlation between features and effect of it, Decision Tree Modelling and Evaluation Metrics.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 This project is about, is the borrower going to repay the loan or not. For this the distribution of target values was observed using value counts. Numerical features were visualized using box plots and categorial featured were vizualized using count plot to observe the distribution. later a Decision Tree was implemented and accuracy was achieved of 73%. Decision Tree Pruning was done to increase the accuracy and accuracy achieved was 83% and finally the Decision Tree was visualized.

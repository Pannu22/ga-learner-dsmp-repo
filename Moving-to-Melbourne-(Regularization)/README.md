### Project Overview

 In this project I am predicting the price for houses in Melbourne and performing regularization.


### Learnings from the project

 In this project I studied : Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Ridge Regressor, R2 Evaluation Metrics



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 For predicting the price for house in Melbourne I used Linear Regression model but the accuracy was low, so I performed different regularization techniques such as Lasso, Ridge, Polynomial Regressor for improving the accuracy of predictions.

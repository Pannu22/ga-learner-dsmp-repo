### Project Overview

 In this project differnt machine learning models are designed for predicting Craters on Mars.


### Learnings from the project

 In this I learn't about different machine learning models such as Voting Classifier, Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project differnt machine learning models applied are Voting Classifier, Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree. After developing these models there accuracy was checked and the maximum accuracy was 90%.

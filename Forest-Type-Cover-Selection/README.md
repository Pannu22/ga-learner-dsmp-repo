### Project Overview

 In the project the cover type of forest is predicted.


### Learnings from the project

 In this project I learn't to chose the important features, importance of features in increasing model accuracy.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 For predicting the Cover type of Forest efficiently at first the important features were chosen. Important features were chosed using visualization such as violin plot, correlation plots. Next standardization was done using StandardScaler it did helped in increasing the accuracy of model. Later the features were selected using SelectPercentile from Sklearn and then an model was made.
